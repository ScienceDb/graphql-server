# GraphQL backend
Skeleton NodeJS project for a graphQL server.

This package integrates the code generated by [code-generator](https://github.com/vsuaste/express_graphql_model_gen).

[Code-generator](https://github.com/vsuaste/express_graphql_model_gen) will generate four folders with the models' information:
* models
* schemas
* resolvers
* migrations

After getting ready the generated code for the models, proceed with the server set up.

## Set up
Clone the repository and run:
```
npm install
node server.js
```

## Example of use
If you followed the example for generating the code described [here](https://github.com/vsuaste/express_graphql_model_gen), you can try the next queries and mutations. Otherwise, just adapt the same queries and mutations for your own models generated.
